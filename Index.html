      <h2>Appearance and Demeanor</h2>
      <p class="Appearance1">
        Darius is a man of average height and build, due to his "active lifestyle" only a thin layer of fat covers his body, he stands straight and with an almost regal posture, however in certain situations he let's go of his regal posture, most likely when in a tavern of criminals or the likes to not draw attention to himself.</p>

      <p class="Appearance1"> He has jet black hair, with an equally black beard, carefully styled with a mustache and goatee, covering most of his chin, deep set sky blue eyes, and over all handsome features, high cheekbones, and almost always a tricksters smirk on his lips. aweweaweaw
